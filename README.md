# 🧠 LandingAI Image Prediction

This project demonstrates how to use [LandingAI](https://landing.ai/) to perform image inference with a pre-trained model using the Python SDK. The code is compatible with both local Python environments and Google Colab.

## 🚀 What This Project Does

- Takes an input image (JPEG/PNG)
- Uses LandingAI’s hosted model endpoint
- Performs image inference (e.g., object detection or classification)
- Displays the prediction results

---

## 📦 Requirements

Install dependencies using:


pip install landingai Pillow
```
Or, if you're using Google Colab, simply run:
```
python
!pip install landingai
```
🖼️ Sample Usage (Google Colab)
```
python
from PIL import Image
from landingai.predict import Predictor
from google.colab import files

# Upload your image
uploaded = files.upload()
image_path = list(uploaded.keys())[0]

# Open image
image = Image.open(image_path)

# API credentials (replace with your actual credentials)
endpoint_id = "YOUR_ENDPOINT_ID"
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Make prediction
predictor = Predictor(endpoint_id, api_key=api_key)
predictions = predictor.predict(image)

# Display predictions
print(predictions)
```

🧠 How It Works
The Predictor from LandingAI sends your image to the specified endpoint.

The response includes predictions such as bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores.

🔐 API Security
Important: Never expose your API key publicly in GitHub. Use environment variables or .env files in real-world projects.
